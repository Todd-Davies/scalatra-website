# todddavies.co.uk #

A little experiment to evaluate the feasibility of migrating my website to a Scala based back end.

Note, this isn't the version of my website that is currently live.

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd todddavies
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
